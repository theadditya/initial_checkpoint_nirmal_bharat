                Ever stand by your bin, carefully separating your wet and dry waste, and have that thought... <strong>"Where does this actually go? Is this even making a difference?"</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                We've all been there. It feels like a black box, doesn't it? You do your part, but the rest of the journey is a total mystery.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's the exact question that sparked everything for us. We were tired of the disconnect. On one side, millions of us are trying to be responsible citizens. On the other, municipal authorities and recyclers are working hard to manage a massive, complex system. We knew there had to be a better way to connect the dots.
            </p>
            <p>
                We thought, "What if we could use technology to bring transparency and trust to the entire process?" And just like that, the idea for <strong>Nirmal Bharat</strong> was born.

                Here's a peek under the hood:
